# # Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

##  Part I - WeatherPy

## Latitude vs. Temperature Plot
1.As the latitude increases the temperature is going to increase

## Latitude vs. Humidity Plot
1. There is no variability with humidity when the latitude is zero. 

## Latitude vs. Cloudiness Plot
1. There seems to be no correlation between cloudiness and the latitude.

## Latitude vs. Wind Speed Plot
1. As the latitude increases, the wind speed increases as well. 

####  Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1. There is a strong negative correlation between the max temperature and the latitude of a city in the Northern Hemisphere. 

####  Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1. There is a strong positive correlation between the max temperature and the latitude of a city in the Southern Hemisphere. 

####  Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1. There is a weak postive correlation between the humidity and the latitude of a city in the Northern Hemisphere. 

####  Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1.There is a weak negative correlation between the humidity and the latitude of a city in the Southern Hemisphere. 

####  Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1.There is a weak positive correlation between the cloudiness and the latitude of a city in the Northern Hemisphere. 

####  Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1.There is a weak negative correlation between the cloudiness and the latitude of a city in the Northern Hemisphere. 

####  Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1.There is a weak negative correlation between the wind speed and the latitude of a city in the Northern Hemisphere. 

####  Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
1.There is a weak positive correlation between the wind speed and the latitude of a city in the Northern Hemisphere. 


## Part II - VacationPy
1. Based on the data that is displayed in the gmaps, humidity is higher along the countries' coasts. 
2. For the 2nd part, I filtered the data in the table to any city that has a temperature between 60 and 80 degrees, no cloudiness and wind speed less than 8 mph. These are weather settings that are ideal for me when I go on vacation. After pulling this data the city that I would like to visit is Vaini.
3. The hotel plots on the gmap indicate that hotels are typically located in humid areas.
